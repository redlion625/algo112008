The basic unit of time is the <b>second</b>.
<ul>
<li> The <b>atomic second</b> is the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of
the radiation corresponding to the transition between two hyperfine levels
of the ground state of cesium 133. 
</li><li>The <b>solar second</b> is 1/86,400 of the length of one solar day,
This second is variable in duration,
a consequence of the irregular and unpredictable rotation rate of the Earth.
</li><li>The <b>ephemeris second</b> is one/31,556,925.9749 of the length of the
tropical year 1900 (vernal equinox to vernal equinox).
</li></ul>
The atomic second is the same length as the ephemeris second. The mean solar
second equalled the atomic second in 1820.

<center><h2><a name="solt">Solar Time </a> </h2></center>
Times based on the Sun include :
<ul>
<li><b>Local Solar time</b> This is what God gave us. The Sun transits (crosses
     the meridian) at noon, local time. This works just fine for farmers, but
     there are two difficulties for civilized man with quartz timepieces. The
     length of the Solar day (noon to noon) varies during the year
     due to the eccentricity of the terrestrial orbit. In
     addition, when your sundial reads noon, your neighbor's doesn't (unless
     it lies directly north or south of yours). Local time is a <em>local</em>
     phenomenon.
</li><li><b>Civil Time</b> This is what the railroads standardized in the
     19<sup>th</sup>
     century, to overcome the problems associated with local time (Whose local
     time do you set your watch to?). Since the
     day is 24 hours long, the angular velocity of the Sun is
     15<sup>o</sup> per hour.
     Civil time consists of 24 <a href="http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/metchev/AST443/images/time_zones.jpg">time zones</a>,
     each nominally 15<sup>o</sup> wide, centered
     on lines
     of longitude which are multiples of 15<sup>o</sup>
     (there are local variations).
     The Eastern time zone is
     centered on 75<sup>o</sup> west longitude.
     Noon EST occurs when the fictitious
     mean Sun crosses the 75<sup>th</sup> degree of longitude.
     The fictitious mean
     Sun differs from the true Sun in that it has a constant angular velocity
     across the sky. The difference (in time) between the true Sun and the
     fictitious mean Sun, the Equation of Time, reaches nearly +/-15 minutes.
     The <a href="http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/metchev/AST443/images/analemma3.jpg">analemma</a>
     on older globes demonstrates the Equation of Time.

     <p>Standard time and daylight time are all parts of Civil time.

</p></li><li><b><a name="ut">Universal Time</a></b> is the zero-point of civil time.
     UT is the civil time
     at 0<sup>o</sup> longitude (the standard meridian), which
     passes through Greenwich,
     England. UT is also known as Greenwich mean time (GMT), and is military
     time Zulu (Z). UT is based on the <em>fictitious mean Sun</em>.

     <p>UT = 12<sup>h</sup> + the Greenwhich hour angle (GHA) or
     <a href="http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/metchev/AST443/glossary.html#rasc">Right Ascension</a> of the
        fictitious mean Sun.

     </p><p>UT1 is UT corrected for the motion of the geographic poles (the Chandler
     wobble and similar phenomena).

     </p><p>UT2 is UT1 with an extrapolated correction for the spindown
     of the Earth.

     </p><p>UTC (Coordinated Universal time) is basically UT1, rounded off. Leap
     seconds are added to keep UTC within 0.9 sec of UT1. UTC is broadcast by
     WWV radio. You can see this time on the seismograph in the ESS lobby.

</p></li><li><b>Atomic Time</b> TAI is kept by atomic clocks.
     It is stable to about 1 part in 10<sup>14</sup>, and is not
     affected by the vagaries of solar system dynamics.

</li><li><b>Ephemeris Time</b> ET, like UT, is based on the mean fictitious Sun, but
     one with the angular velocity of the Sun on 1900 0.5 January. The right
     ascension of the fictitious mean Sun is given by the expression<br>
     RA=18<sup>h</sup>38<sup>m</sup>45.836<sup>s</sup> + 
     8,640,184.542<sup>s</sup> T<sub>E</sub> + 0.0929<sup>s</sup>
     T<sub>E</sub><sup>2</sup><br>
     ET-UT = 24.349<sup>s</sup> + 72.318<sup>s</sup>T<sub>E</sub>
     + 29.950<sup>s</sup>T<sub>E</sub><sup>2</sup>

     <p>Ephemeris time was formally abolished in 1984, and was replaced with
     Terrestrial Time (<b>TT</b>; formerly Terrestrial Dynamical Time (<b>TDT</b>) and
     Terrestrial Barycentric Time (<b>TBT</b>).
     For all practical purposes, TT = UT1.<br>
     TT - TAI = 32<sup>s</sup>.184

</p></li><li><b>TDB</b> = TT + 0.001658 sin(g) + 0.000014 sin(2g) seconds, where <br>
     g = 357<sup>o</sup>.531 + 0<sup>o</sup>.9856003 (JD - 2451545.0)<br>
     g is the mean anomaly of the Earth in its orbit around the Sun.<br> 
     TBD is referred to the barycenter of the Solar System. It is an ideal time
     calculated for an ideal Earth in a circular orbit around the Sun. The
     1.7 ms periodic deviation is a general relativistic effect
    due to the
    variation in the gravitational potential around the Earth's orbit.

</li><li><b>TCB</b> is an ideal clock corrected for GR effects in a flat
     space-time frame far from the Solar System. Due to gravitational
     time dilation, TCB is 49 sec/century faster than TDB.

</li><li>TT, TDB, and TCB  are independent of the Earth's rotation.

</li><li><b>Heliocentric time</b>. The time at the center of the Sun, or more
appropriately, the barycenter of the solar system.<br>
Involves correction for the light travel time from the terrestrial
barycenter to the barycenter of the solar system. This ranges up to 
±16 minutes.

<center><h2><a name="jd">Julian Days</a> </h2></center>

Astronomers realized a long time ago that the civil time system is cumbersome
for determining lengths of intervals. Just how many days have passed since
July 4, 1776? To get around some of these dificulties, astronomers generally
use <strong>Julian dates</strong>. The Julian date is the number of
ephemeris days elapsed since 12<sup>h</sup> UT on 1 January, 4713 BC (which is
-4712 AD). The Julian date on January 1.5, 2000 was 2,451,545.0. This is
defined as J2000.0. Note that the JD increments at 12<sup>h</sup> UT (Greenwich
Mean Time).

<p>Because the JD is a large number, you will often see the 
Reduced Julian Date (JD-2,400,000) used. The
modified Julian Date (MJD) is also commonly used. MJD=JD-2,400,000.5. 
Note the extra 0.5 day in the definition. Modified Julian dates increment at
the same time as Universal Time. 
The Heliocentric Julian Day (HJD) is the time reduced to the barycenter of the
Solar System. 
Be sure you know what convention is being used.


</p><p>To convert the civil time into the Julian day, use the following
   algorithm<br>
</p><center>JD = fix(365.25*f) + fix(30.6001*(g+1)) + d + A + 1,720,994.5<br>
where y is the year, m is the month, d is the day of the month, <br>
f=y for m&gt;2 and f=y-1 for m&lt;3<br>
g=m for m&gt;2 and g=m+12 for m&lt;3<br>
A=2-fix(f/100) + fix(f/400).<br>
</center>
This algorithm works for Gregorian civil calendar dates only.


<p>When you compute with Julian dates, be sure to use double precision
floating point arithmetic.

</p><p>The IDL procedure <b>JULDATE</b> will return the reduced Julian date. In IDL,
type <b>juldate,jd</b>, and you will be prompted for input.

</p><hr>
<center><h2><a name="st">Sidereal Time</a> </h2></center>
<b>Sidereal Time</b>
is based on the Earth's sidereal
rotation period (rotation with respect to the stars). The length of
the sidereal day is 24 sidereal hours, or
23<sup>h</sup>56<sup>m</sup>4<sup>s</sup> Solar time. The difference is due
to the angular motion of
the earth around the Sun. In a year there is one more sidereal day than Solar
day. The sidereal time is a measured locally. The local sideral time (LST) is
the right ascension of the zenith. The hour angle HA of an object with right
ascension RA is given by <b>HA=LST-RA</b>

<p><b>GMST</b> (Greenwich Mean Sidereal Time) at 0<sup>h</sup> UT =
 24110.54841 + 8640184.812866 T<sub>U</sub> + 0.093104T<sub>U</sub><sup>2</sup>
 - 6.2x10<sup>-6</sup>T<sub>U</sub><sup>3</sup> seconds

</p><p><b>GAST</b> (Greenwich Apparent Sidereal Time) = GMST + the <em>equation of
the equinoxes</em>.<br> The <em>Equation of the Equinoxes</em> is the
total nutation in longitude time the cosine of the true obliquity of the
ecliptic. It ranges from +0.8 to +1.2 seconds.

</p><p><b>LAST</b> (Local Apparent Sidereal Time) is the hour angle of the
ascending node of the ecliptic.

</p><p><b>LMST</b> (Local Mean Sidereal Time) = GMST - geodetic longitude.

</p><p>Note: both the sideral and solar days are 86,400 seconds long. The sidereal
second is shorter than the solar second by
0.997269566414 - 0.586x10<sup>-10</sup>T<sub>E</sub>


</p><p><b>Right ascension</b> is generally measured in units of time, not
degrees of arc.
24 hours of time corresponds to 360 degrees of arc at the equator.
Therefore,
</p><ul>
<li>1<sup>h</sup>=15<sup>o</sup>/cos(δ)
</li><li>1<sup>m</sup>=15'/cos(δ), and
</li><li>1<sup>s</sup>=15"/cos(δ)
</li></ul>
where δ is
the declination of the target. You can use analogous formulae
to convert degrees of arc to distances on the earth's surface.

<hr>
<center><h2><a name="var">The Variability of Time</a> </h2></center>

Ephemeris time, which is referred to the <em>fictitious mean Sun</em> and the
<em>mean Equinox</em> is uniform.

<p></p><ul>True local time varies from ephemeris time because of:
<li>Periodic variations in the Sun-Earth distance.
</li><li><ul>Secular changes, including:
   <li>Tidal friction, which causes the length of the day to increase by
       0.0016 sec/century.<br> dt/t = 4.5x10<sup>-8</sup> sec/day, with an
       acceleration term proportional to t<sup>2</sup>.
   </li><li>Irregular variations in the Earth's rotation due to small changes in
       the moment of inertia.<br>
       The effect is cumulative but unpredictable.<br>
       Relative to 1972, the effect was -.005 seconds in 1871, and +0.002 
       seconds in 1907.
   </li><li>Seasonal variations in I due to weather.
   </li><li>man-made changes from reservoirs (increasing I)
   </li><li>sea-level changes
   </li></ul>
</li></ul>

<center><h2><a name="refs">Effect of Time on Position</a> </h2></center>

Because of motions of the measurement frame (the precession of the equinoxes) 
and intrinsic motions (propoer motions), coordinates specified in the
Equatorial or Celestial coordinate system are strictly valid at only one 
instant of time. Therefore, it is necessary to supplement the coordinates
with two more pieces of information:
<ul>
<li>the <b>epoch</b> of the measurement. This is the time at which the position
was measured. If one knows the intrinsic motions of a moving object,
one can then extrapolate to predict the position at other epochs.

</li><li>the <b>equinox</b> of the coordinates, which makes the RA and DEC of a
stationary object change with time.
One reduces the measured position to a standard equinox (e.g., B1950 or J2000),
essentially by adding or subtracting the expected precessional shifts.
Equinox B1950 was standard prior to about 1980; now J2000 is the standard
epoch. Presumably J2100 will become standard about the year 2050.
</li></ul>

Note that the terms "equinox" and "epoch" are often confused; the correct
term can often be discerned from its context. An observation made in 1984
and precessed to J2000 coordinates should be referred to as <em> Epoch 1984,
Equinox J2000</em>, but is often simply referred to as "Epoch 2000". If proper
motions are negligable, the difference is inconsequential,
