Note(s):

The coordinates above are the most accurately known positions for this station relative to the NAD83CSRS coordinate system. Although these coordinates are very accurate within the Canadian Spatial Reference System and with respect to the defined NAD83 datum, they may not be consistent with NAD83 coordinates officially adopted and published by provincial agencies for monumented geodetic control points.

CGVD28 - Canadian Geodetic Vertical Datum 1928, mean sea level (adopted, public vertical reference system). The average height of the surface of the sea for all stages of the tide. Usually determined by averaging height readings observed hourly over a minimum period of 19 years.
